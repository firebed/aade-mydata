## Introduction

This package provides an expressive, fluent interface to ΑΑΔΕ myDATA invoicing REST API. It handles almost all the boilerplate code for sending, cancelling and requesting invoices.

## Official Documentation

- Official documentation is available 👉 [on our documentation site](https://docs.invoicemaker.gr/getting-started)
- myDATA webpage: [AADE myDATA](https://www.aade.gr/mydata)
- myDATA documentation: [AADE myDATA REST API v1.0.10](https://www.aade.gr/sites/default/files/2024-11/myDATA%20API%20Documentation%20v1.0.10_official_erp.pdf)

## Requirements

In order to use this package, you will need first a `aade id` and a `Subscription key`. You can get these credentials by signing up to mydata rest api.

- Development: [Sign up to mydata development api](https://mydata-dev-register.azurewebsites.net/)
- Production: [Sign up to mydata production api](https://www.aade.gr/mydata)
- guzzlehttp/guzzle >= 7.0

| Version | PHP | myDATA  | Support |
|---------|-----|---------|---------|
| ^v5.x   | 8.1 | v1.0.10 | Active  |
| ^v4.x   | 8.1 | v1.0.8  | Ended   |
| ^v3.x   | 8.1 | v1.0.7  | Ended   |
| ^v2.x   | 8.1 | v1.0.5  | Ended   |
| ^v1.x   | 8.0 | v1.0.3  | Ended   |

## Installation

To install through Composer, run the following command:

```
composer require firebed/aade-mydata
```

## Setup

Once you have the user id and the subscription key use the following code to set the environment and the credentials:

```php
$env = "dev"; // For production use "prod"
$user_id = "your-user-id";
$subscription_key = "your-subscription-key";

MyDataRequest::setEnvironment($env);
MyDataRequest::setCredentials($user_id, $subscription_key);
```

For development, you may need to disable client verification if you are not using https:

```php
MyDataRequest::verifyClient(false);
```

## Send invoice example

```php
use Firebed\AadeMyData\Http\SendInvoices;
use Firebed\AadeMyData\Models\Invoice;
use Firebed\AadeMyData\Exceptions\MyDataException;

// Prepare your invoices, for simplicity we will use an array of empty
// Invoice objects. You should populate these objects with your own data.
$invoices = [new Invoice(), new Invoice()];
$sender = new SendInvoices();

try {
    $responses = $sender->handle($invoices);
    
    $errors = [];
    foreach ($responses as $response) {
        if ($response->isSuccessful()) { 
            // This invoice was successfully sent to myDATA.     
            // Each response has an index value which corresponds
            // to the index (-1) of the $invoices array.
            
            $index = $response->getIndex();
            $uid = $response->getInvoiceUid();
            $mark = $response->getInvoiceMark();
            $cancelledByMark = $response->getCancellationMark();
            $qrUrl = $response->getQrUrl();
    
            // If you need to relate the response to your local invoice
            // $invoice = $invoices[$index - 1];    
    
            print_r(compact('index', 'uid', 'mark', 'cancelledByMark', 'qrUrl'));
        } else {
            // There were some errors for a specific invoice. See errors for details.
            foreach ($response->getErrors() as $error) {
                $errors[$response->getIndex() - 1][] = $error->getCode() . ': ' . $error->getMessage();
            }
        }
    }
} catch (MyDataException $e) {
    // There was a communication error. None of the invoices were sent.
    echo "Σφάλμα επικοινωνίας: " . $e->getMessage();
}
```
